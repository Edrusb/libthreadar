	HOWTO USE SOURCE CODE FOUND IN GIT

In GIT you will only find source code, and no generated files. The configure
script for example is generated from configure.ac file with autoconf tool,
so you will not find it there an need specific tools to build this kind of
files that are usually included in tarball released packages.

For that reason, when using code from GIT, you need the following additional
tools:
- gnu M4  ( http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/ )
- autoconf ( http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ )
- automake ( http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/ )
- libtool ( http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/ )

If they are not present on your system, you must first install them.
You can then use the following demo script (it may work or not on you system,
that's more to be considered as a reminder of the different steps to follow
to build the configure script and Makefiles):

	misc/init

Once the configure and Makefile files have been generated, you are ready
to build libthreadar as detailed in the documentation. in brief the following
commands should correspond to most needs:

	./configure
	make
	make install

If you just want to build a fresh tarball simply use:

       ./configure
       make dist
